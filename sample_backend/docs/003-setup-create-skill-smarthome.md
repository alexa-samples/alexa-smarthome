<span style="color:#ccc">3.1.1</span> In a web browser to the Amazon Developer Console at [https://developer.amazon.com/home.html](https://developer.amazon.com/home.html). If not already authenticated, you may have to _Sign In_ with your Amazon Developer Account .

<span style="color:#ccc">3.1.2</span> Select the _Alexa_ tab from the top menu.

<span style="color:#ccc">3.1.3</span> On the _Get started with Alexa_ page and in the _Alexa Skills Kit_ box, click the **Get Started >** button.
